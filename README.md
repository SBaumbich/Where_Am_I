##Project Overview
This iOS app allows a user to view his/her current GPS location on a Map and displays the nearest postal address. As the user travels, a pin will be placed indicating the path the user is taking.

##What I learned?
I learned how to:

* Leveraged Core Location, and MapKit frameworks to find users location and display information on a map view
* Parse GPS specific information to a user's device in a readable format
* Pinning a user's current location to the map every second
* Using reverseGeocodeLocation to find the nearest address.

##Why is this project meaningful to my career?
Using GPS and map functionality is an essential part of most iOS apps theses days. The ability to comfortably manipulate theses built in functionalities will have tremendous benefits in the long run.

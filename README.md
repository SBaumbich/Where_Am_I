##Project Overview
This iOS app allows a user to view his/her current GPS location on a Map and displays the nearest postal address. As the user travels, a pin will be placed indicating the path the user is taking.

##What I learned?
I learned how to:

* Create a new project from existing iOS app templates
* Add buttons, images, labels and create user interfaces for the app using the Storyboard
* Leverage the Model View Controller (MVC) design principles; this includes writing custom model code, and using UIViewController, and UIView
* Create Outlet and Action connections between the views and view controllers. 
Benefit from the power of Delegates by using them in code
* Navigate between two scenes in the app using UINavigationController
* Play audio files using AVFoundation’s AVAudioEngine class
* Run the iOS simulator and download the app on a physical device 
* Search documentation, resolve bugs, and read other people’s code

##Why is this project meaningful to my career?
MVC is the cornerstone of all iOS app development; understanding these principles early will set me on the path for success. Also, learning how to find answers to development questions by searching documentation emulates the practice of expert software engineers.
